This is a basic sample CRUD operation app with Dart's own Serverpod.

In this you will able to see 3 diferent files which ends with :

1. `flutter` -  Frontend code which is a normal Flutter project predesigned to work with serverpod.
2. `client` - Auto generating file which helps to connect Flutter and Server - Don't touch
3. `server` - We write all the serverside codes and endpoints here.
